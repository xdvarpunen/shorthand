# Core

> To be honest this is necessary later, but for now velocity is all we need. Keeping this file in memory to not forget.

This folder contains operations done on simple data type `List<List<Point>>`. Idea is to enable moving to C++ or such later for performance benefits or simply try another language for sake of curiousity. Semantic Core Pattern is the term behind this approach. Outside this folder we need velocity so this folder methods may be called.
