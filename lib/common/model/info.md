# Terminology

Use common types to access operations.

```
point (Point)

line (List<Point>)

lines (List<List<Point>>)
```

---

Use `Toolbox` within types to operate on `List<List<Point>>` type.
Actually hmm. This is why it made frustrating. Should not operate on ´List<List<Point>>´.

// we need type to implement law of demeter
// attach operations
