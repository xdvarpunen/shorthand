class Points {
  // Think of closer to linq?
}

// Operator DSL

// List<List<Point>
// List<Point>
// Point
// Stroke
// Line
// Segment
// LineAngle

// In a sense you can not operate on angle... aa we want discover so in a sense this is about facade namespace
// List<List<Point> as return type and parameter neutral
// Stroke should not exist... it's just line

// LineAngle should exist, it is BAG
// enum StrokeCutDirection should exist, it is knowledge of domain

// PointManager is entity on its own...?

// Ooh I could do like linq, cast to something and get that type specific operations

// Toolbox makes sense, can grasp what need at what time. in a sense this is what linq does. you continue operation based on result object
// Law of demeter, attach to types the operation seems most logical. it is not wrong do have separate class that is used by type. helps thinking.

// Linq vs Railway
